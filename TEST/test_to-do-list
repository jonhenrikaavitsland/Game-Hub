Things that need to be taken care of only when the design is finished


1. Different color options and design options for the popup via hamburger bar checkbox hack.
2. Ask MJ about wrapping the page to a max size of 1500 px or something like that and how to make it show just as much white-space on both sides of the page. 
3. Consider changing the icons on top for text links, it might look smoother.
